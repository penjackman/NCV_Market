    # Algorithm:

    # Use Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) to smooth out the stock price over a window of 3 days 
    # (as stock prices fluctuate too much between consecutive days)
    # Then calculate rate-of-change between EMAs
    # Calculate the slope of rate-of-change by comparing it with a 45 degree positive slope line
    # A stock is GOOD if it has a decent slope compared to that line 
    # Even a flat rate-of-change is really good (slope of 0)
    # So most slopes end up in -ve values, because as price increases, slope falls
 
    # create timeseries with closing stock prices and their dates
    psCloses = pd.Series(sCloses, sDates)

    # panda has Exponential Weight Moving Average (aka EMA or EWMA or EWM)
    # EMA is like Simple Moving Average (SMA) over "Span" number of days except it is weight by how old it is
    # SMA Example. March 1st - $10, 2nd - $20, 3rd - 30. SMA = $20 for date March 3rd. March 1st SMA: NaN, 2nd: NaN
    # Next SMA:  March 2nd = #20, 3rd = #30, 4th = $40.  SMA = $30 for date March 4th. 
    # SMA has values for all dates except the first 2 dates when Span = 3. 
    # EMA is SMA multiplied by a fraction determined how old it is (the older SMAs become smaller)
    pMeans = psCloses.ewm(span=3, adjust=False).mean()
